# Play CodeNames on Your Computer! 

*Codenames is a 2015 party card game designed by Vlaada Chv√°til and published by Czech Games Edition. Two teams compete by each having a "spymaster" give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team.*

Cloning this repo will give you access to the source code and an executable. The game can be run either by running *python main.py* or by simply running the executable. The CodeMaster card will be printed to cmd and a Tkinter window will be opened where the game can be played.
